This project aims to identify prominent and influential researchers in various fields. 
This will be  accomplished by calculating degree and betweenness centrality for a graph 
that models relationships between researchers, where nodes represent authors and edges 
connect authors that have published with each other before.

Using the arXiv Dataset, we also plan to group new publications into a field of study by 
using Word2Vec or some other NLP processes on the Title and Abstract. The model will be 
trained on existing Titles and Abstracts, with the categories of the publication as the label. 
Then, we will use centrality methods (degree / betweenness centrality) to show the most 
prominent figures in the predicted field. This will tell the publisher who to reach out to 
if they want more information on their field.
